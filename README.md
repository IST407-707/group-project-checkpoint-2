# Group Project Checkpoint 2 Rubric

For the second checkpoint, you will have identified your data and developed a descriptive analysis.  This will be contained in a markdown file called 'checkpoint2_data_analysis.ipynb' that includes:

1. Distributions (where appropriate)
2. Analysis of missing data and outliers
3. Plans for cleaning, including imputation, scaling, encoding, and other feature transformations
4. Any data enrichment you have done or plan to do (e.g., bringing in new datasets)
5. Initial analysis of feature importance (if classification)
6. Observations about corrlelations in the data or other notable statistical features

In addition, your second checkpoint should now specify your refined focus, incorporating feedback and new understandings gleaned from the data.  This part of the submission will be presented in a markdown file called 'checkpoint2_narrative.md.' Explain how you have incorporated feedback from me ( and / or peers).  Additionally, you should now have a revised project plan, and an analysis of how your activities have conformed to your previous plan.

This checkpoint is worth 7 points on your final grade, two of which come from teammates evaluations.  The remaining five points are apportioned as follows:

- 2 points - quality and clarity of data analysis.  Did you address the above points?  Is your submitted notebook well organized and complete?
- 2 points - Insights and clarity of plan moving forward.  Do I understand what you are doing?  Have you addressed points of feedback?  Does your proposed plan take into account the reality of your data?
- 1 point - Do you have a concrete plan moving forward?  Is it realistic?  Does it specify who is doing what?
